This source code corresponds to the study “Shape-conformal porous frameworks for full coverage of neural organoids and high-resolution electrophysiology” to be published in Nature Biomedical Engineering. It describes the general workflow of processing the raw data of electrophysiology as recorded with 3D organoid interfaces.
DataAnalysis.ipynb reads the recorded raw data from multiple channels, which is a series of potential data points as a function of time. It filters the raw data, detects the peaks, and catagorizes the peaks of each channels into clusters. It plots the waveform of each cluster of each channel, following which clusters with artifact-like waveforms will be removed.
example_data.h5 contains raw potential data from two example channels. One demonstrates the typical results of signal, and the other shows the case of artifacts.
t.h5 contains the corresponding time points of the example data.
RemovingArtifacts.csv will be read by the main code to de-mark the artifact-like clusters.
